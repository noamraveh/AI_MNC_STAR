anger,My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that  he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's  house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I  felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so  he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is  I was in a bad mood then).     
sadness,I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good  friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them  I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind  this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made  up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was  sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.

joy,During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close    friend of mine

I treated him as a friend and  did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet  him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very  unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.     
anger,We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the  inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there  was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating  lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them  and then left.

anger,Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very  uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him  furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence  because of traditional moral values.       
sadness,My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it  was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I  getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not  expect too much from going to the university.     
disgust,My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth.   One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This  meant that I was very busy and could not maintain order.  His  behaviour disgusted me.

anger,My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt  insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  person.  However I could not apologize     
sadness,Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before  the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I  got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all       good I felt a little sad.     
disgust,Whenever I spoke to a female classmate I felt disgusted.  She  said meaningless things and seemed to indicate something to me  but I did not love/like her.

guilt,Once while playing tennis with my classmate I lost a few tennis  balls.  I found one near the tennis court and took it to be mine  despite thinking that it might belong to the student in the next  court.  I felt guilty.

joy,It was the first time that I gave a birthday present to my friend.    She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of  the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy.      
fear,It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I  had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that  I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld  have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period  - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice  experience.  When I thought about the future     
anger,The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often  grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This  made me angry.     
sadness,When I was in primary 6     
disgust,At hostel     
shame,My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were  his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.   Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I  felt ashamed at having misunderstood him.     
guilt,In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging  person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time  to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care  of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my  own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty.     
joy,In August     
fear,On Christmas eve     
anger,In September 1984     
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September  I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in  the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not  find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about  sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.   I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.     
disgust,My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played  the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell  him that I did not like to listen to the songs

anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me  and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.   When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university   there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five  days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another  child to teach.     
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After  three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and  failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others  would think that I had not prepared for it.     
disgust,I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the  door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit  and bring the germs in the house.

guilt,I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when  I called out loudly.
